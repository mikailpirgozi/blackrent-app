fix: UUID generation - generate only once per component

ðŸ”§ UUID GENERATION FIX:
- HandoverProtocolForm.tsx: Fixed UUID generation to create ID only once per component
- Prevents duplicate key errors when saving protocols
- UUID is now generated once and reused throughout component lifecycle

âœ… RESULT:
- No more duplicate key constraint violations
- Protocols can be saved successfully
- UUID remains consistent during component re-renders

ðŸš€ IMPACT: Protocols workflow now fully functional without duplicate key errors!
