- `public/index.html` - Service Worker registration re-enabled

---

### Phase 1.1: IndexedDB Storage Layer ✅
- [x] Created `IndexedDBManager` class
- [x] Implemented 3 object stores:
  - `images` - Temporary image storage during upload
  - `drafts` - Protocol draft recovery
  - `queue` - Background Sync upload queue
- [x] Full CRUD operations for all stores
- [x] Statistics and cleanup methods
- [x] 2GB+ storage capacity (vs 10MB SessionStorage)

**Files Created:**
- `src/utils/storage/IndexedDBManager.ts` (600+ lines)

**Key Features:**
- Survives page reloads
- Automatic DB initialization
- Promise-based async API
- Comprehensive logging

---

### Phase 1.2: Device Capability Detection ✅
- [x] Created `DeviceCapabilityDetector` class
- [x] RAM detection (navigator.deviceMemory)
- [x] CPU cores detection (navigator.hardwareConcurrency)
- [x] Network type & speed detection
- [x] Performance benchmarking (canvas rendering)
- [x] PWA installation detection
- [x] Adaptive settings calculation

**Files Created:**
- `src/utils/device/DeviceCapabilityDetector.ts` (350+ lines)

**Adaptive Logic:**
- RAM < 2GB → batch=1, quality='mobile'
- RAM 2-4GB → batch=2, quality='protocol'
- RAM 4-8GB → batch=4, quality='protocol'
- RAM 8GB+ → batch=6, quality='highQuality'
- Network & performance adjustments

---

### Phase 1.3: Background Sync Service Worker ✅
- [x] Added Background Sync event listener to Service Worker
- [x] Implemented queue processing from IndexedDB
- [x] Upload retry logic with error tracking
- [x] Push notifications for upload status
- [x] Updated `usePWA` hook with sync detection

**Files Modified:**
- `public/sw.js` - Added 200+ lines of Background Sync code
- `src/hooks/usePWA.ts` - Added sync capability detection

**Key Features:**
- Automatic upload when online
- Max 3 retry attempts
- Error notifications
- Success summary notifications

---

### Phase 2.3: Background Sync Queue Manager ✅
- [x] Created `BackgroundSyncQueue` class
- [x] Task enqueueing to IndexedDB
- [x] Automatic sync registration
- [x] Manual queue processing fallback
- [x] Queue statistics

**Files Created:**
- `src/utils/sync/BackgroundSyncQueue.ts` (250+ lines)

**Key Features:**
- PWA Background Sync integration
- Manual fallback for non-PWA
- Comprehensive error handling
- Queue stats dashboard

---

### Phase 2.1: Streaming Image Processor ✅
- [x] Created `StreamingImageProcessor` class
- [x] Adaptive batch processing
- [x] Immediate memory cleanup
- [x] Progress tracking with ETA
- [x] Background Sync integration
- [x] Abort capability

**Files Created:**
- `src/utils/processing/StreamingImageProcessor.ts` (400+ lines)

**Key Features:**
- Memory footprint: 1-3 images (vs 18+ old system)
- Process → Upload → Cleanup → Repeat
- Peak memory tracking
- Comprehensive stats
